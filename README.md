## <a name="welcome"></a> Welcome

Welcome to the HNG Team Fury organization. This is where we will all (backend, frontend, mobile, and design) be coordinating, sharing, and collaborating.

## <a name="overview"></a> Overview

We will be coordinating our work through teams. Each team will each have its own repository and project board. The repository is where all work will be located while the project board os where all team tasks (cards) will be located. The team tasks (cards) in the project board will be organized by To Do, In Progress, and Done.

This is an agile process of project management. The team tasks (cards) are modular tasks that add up to the main task of each team. This allows each team to split the work efficiently while working together towards a common goal.

All members are to be added to one of the available teams, if you are not part of the team yet please contact [insert contact of person responsible].

## <a name="orgstructure"></a> Organizational Structure

The executive team is composed of the team lead and its deputies and helpers. The team is the most accountable and has the responsibility of ensuring that the all the teams work efficiently and effectively as a whole to reach a common goal.

If any one has an enquiry, contact one of the helpers of your respective team. The contacted helper will then respond, but if they cannot respond, the enquiry will be escalated to the deputy of your respective team. If the deputy cannot respond, the the enquiry will be escalated to the team lead for a final response.
